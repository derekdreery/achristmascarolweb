            <p><em>A Christmas Carol</em> is intended for SATB choirs,
            children’s choirs, or ideally the two combined. There are also
            occasions where audience singing  is encouraged. A number of small
            character solos can be sung from within the choir; the parts of 
            Ebenezer and the Spirits are more substantial. The piece is
            suitable for performance by choirs, community groups and schools 
            etc…</p>

            <p>The libretto retains much of Dickens’ text and is by playwright
            and actor Deborah McAndrew, winner of “Best New Play” in the 2014
            UK Theatre Awards.</p>

            <p>Vocal scores with piano accompaniment (both SATB &amp; 2-part)
            are available to hire; orchestral parts and parts for small band
            are available on request. <em>Duration: 50-55 minutes.</em></p>

            <p>The work was performed twice through Christmas 2014; the
            orchestral premier at Stockport Town Hall and a collaborative
            performance with adult and youth choirs at Lichfield Cathedral -
            receiving a standing ovation.</p>

            <p>Any choirs / groups / orchestras / schools etc... that might be 
            interested in performing the piece can contact me via:
